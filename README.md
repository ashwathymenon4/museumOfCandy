# Museum of Candy Project
Museum of Candy Project is a responsive static web-page that is a sample of what an introductory page to a large web-app or a one page web-app would resemble.

The web-page components will re-arrange automatically based on the screen/window size.

**NOTE** : The navbar components are sample placeholders and are currently not meant to redirect to any pages.
